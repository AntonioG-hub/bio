# Bio AI — Product Rules (LOCKED)

## One-liner
Bio AI explains biomedical papers in structured, depth-controlled outputs.

---

## Target (LOCKED)
- Snapshot → anyone
- Academic → early-year / master students
- Deep Dive → PhD students, researchers, clinicians

---

## Modes (LOCKED ORDER)
1. Snapshot
2. Academic
3. Deep Dive

---

## Output Structure (LOCKED)

### Snapshot
- paper_type_note
- summary
- why_it_matters
- key_concepts
- limits

### Academic
- paper_type_note
- summary
- why_it_matters
- key_concepts
- limits

### Deep Dive
- paper_type_note
- summary
- why_it_matters
- key_concepts
- bias_and_methodological_issues
- mechanisms_and_pathways
- limits

---

## Article Type Declaration (LOCKED)
- Every output MUST include `paper_type_note`
- Allowed values:
  - Review
  - Original research article
  - Clinical study (declared, no guidance)

---

## Limits Definition (LOCKED)
- Limits = paper limitations / scientific unknowns / open challenges
- NEVER mention AI or model limitations

---

## Quantitative Data Rules (LOCKED)
- Snapshot: NO numbers anywhere
- Academic & Deep Dive:
  - Summary: NO numbers
  - Numbers allowed ONLY in:
    - why_it_matters
    - key_concepts
  - Numbers must be explained and proportional to audience

---

## References Policy
- No external citations (DOI, PubMed)
- Use narrative references only (“the authors report…”)

---

## What Must NEVER Change
- Mode names and order
- Section names
- Meaning of `limits`
- Presence of `paper_type_note`
