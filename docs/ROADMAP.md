Status legend:
- DONE
- IN PROGRESS
- NEXT
- LOCKED (do not start)

---

## FASE 0 — Foundations (DONE)
- Target + value definition
- Scope for v1 clarified
- Output sections defined

---

## FASE 1 — Core Output Quality (DONE)
- Modes: Snapshot / Academic / Deep Dive
- Audiences defined per mode
- `paper_type_note` added to all modes
- `limits` meaning locked (scientific limitations only)
- Quantitative rules locked:
  - Snapshot: no numbers
  - Academic/Deep Dive: no numbers in summary; numbers only in why/key_concepts

---

## FASE 2 — MVP Technical (IN PROGRESS → almost DONE)
DONE:
- Next.js App Router running
- `/api/analyze` works end-to-end with OpenAI
- Minimal chat UI works

NEXT:
- Add analyses history (in-memory → DB)
- Add multi-provider option layer (OpenAI primary, Anthropic fallback)
- Add persistence (Supabase)

---

## FASE 3 — Positioning & Sellability (LOCKED)
- Landing page + pricing draft
- Copywriting + value proposition testing

---

## FASE 4 — Light Validation (LOCKED)
- 5–10 target users
- Qualitative feedback (no new features; only prompt/output tuning)

---

## FASE 5 — Module C (LOCKED)
- Gene/drug inline cards (side panel)

---

## FASE 6 — Module B (LOCKED)
- Clinical trial explanation module

---

## FASE 7 — Platform (LOCKED)
